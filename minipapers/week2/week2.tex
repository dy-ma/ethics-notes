% Sentence 1: In your own words, concisely and accurately summarize a passage from the text.
In response to the objection that we don't have the time nor effort to thoroughly consider the utilitarian effects of our actions, John Stuart Mill replies that humans have been pondering laws of right and wrong for all of humanity, and that these laws are correct if they conform to a utilitarian view, which most do.
% Sentences 2-3: Tell me something about its role in the argument (Is it a premise? How does the author justify it? What conclusion does the author use it to argue for?). 
This is an objection by Mill to a common objection of utilitarianism. While the original claim points out a potential issue of the practical implementation of following utilitarian principles, Mill argues that it actually isn't as difficult as it is being made out to be.
% Sentences 4-5: Raise an objection or question you would like the author to address. 
However, I'd like to bring up that while we look back at chattel slavery with disgust, many of our ancestors didn't see it that way. If we are simply to follow the rules we already believe in, without thoroughly considering the effects, then how will we ever recognize the immorality of our actions today?
